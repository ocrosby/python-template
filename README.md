# Python Template

This is a template repository for creating Python projects.

From a repository created from this template, you can create a new project by following these steps:

## Step 1. Initial Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Step 2. Commit and Push

Please be careful to not attempt to commit and push back to the template repository.
These steps are intended to be run in a new repository created from this template.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial setup"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/init
```

Yes, that's all you need to do.
